<article><h1>About Me</h1></article>
<aside><h1>Andrew Daunais</h1>My name is Andrew Daunais and I'm currently a student of CodeCrew's Code School, a 6-month bootcamp-style coding program. After completing high school, I went to Austin Peay State University and received a bachelor's degree in Music Performance. After continuing on for one year of graduate school at Shenandoah University for Classical Voice Pedagogy, I realized my career aspirations had shifted.<br/><br/>I'm now on track to becoming a full stack developer with diverse abilities and a determined mindset instilled in me from my music education. I'm a practical thinker who loves working through problems and puzzling concepts, both with people and on my own. My main interest lies in video game development and design. I have a strong desire to work my way into a job in video game development to be a cog in the machine of creative problem solving.</aside>
